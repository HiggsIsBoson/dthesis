\section{Obtained Cross-section Upper-limit}
$\mathrm{CL_s}$ value is calculated as the function of the signal strength $\mu (\in [0,5])$ in the hypothetical test. Therefore, the upper limit on $\mu$ can be determined as:
\begin{align}
\mu_{95\mathrm{CL}} := \mu(\mathrm{CL_s}=0.05).
\end{align}
This can be straightforwardly interpreted into the upper limit on the excluded cross-section ($\sigma_{95\mathrm{CL}}$), and it is a completely model-independent presentation of the result once the decay chain and the masses of gluino and EW-gauginos are specified.
Figure \ref{fig::Result::xsecUL::QQC1QQC1}-\ref{fig::Result::xsecUL::TTN1TTN1} present the results for the reference models \textbf{QQC1QQC1}, \textbf{QQC1BTC1} and \textbf{TTN1TTN1}. \\
%, and the full result are in the Appendix \ref{sec::Result::xsecUL::nonBenchMark}.
