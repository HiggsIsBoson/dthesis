This thesis presents the search for gluinos using proton-proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13\tev$. Focusing on the final state with one leptons, all relevant 45 decay chains for pair produced gluinos are explored, together with various scenarios of the mass spectra, aiming to provide the most general result achievable in principle. \\

The highlight of the analysis is designing a dedicated data-driven background estimation method, reinforce the confidence on the estimation by reducing the reliance on simulation which typically less performing in an extreme phase space. \\

The analysis is performed with the data recorded by the ATLAS detector with an integraded luminosity of 36.1 $\ifb$. 
In the unblinded signal regions, no significant excess is found.
Constraints are set on each of the 45 models of gluino decay chain.
Exclusion upto $1.7\tev - 2.0 \tev$ in gluino mass and upto $\sim 1\tev$ in the lightest neutralino mass is widely confirmed 
with typical mass spectra of gluino and EW gauginos, while upto $1.5\tev - 1.9 \tev$ in gluino mass is excluded in case of the compressed EW gauginos which is motivated by the dark matter relic observation.
