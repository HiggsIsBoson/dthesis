\section{Kinematics dependence on Signal Mass Configuration} \label{sec::App::kineMap}
The trend of the kinematical variables over the mass grids are shown in Figurere \ref{fig::SRdefinition::kineMap_QQC1QQC1_x12}-\ref{fig::SRdefinition::kineMap_TTN1TTN1}. The color scale (z-axis) indicates the mean of the distribution in the variables, for the signal process in the mass point designated by the xy-coordinate. Three QQC1QQC1 grids (\xhalf, \varx, \DMth) and one TTN1TTN1 grid are displayed as the benchmark model for BV/BT signal regions and the 3B signal regions respectively. 

One can find that the variables related to transverse momenta of outgoing particles such as $\meffInc$, $\lepPt$ and $\met$ simply scale with the mass splitting, while the other variables such as aplanarity and $\metOverMeff$ etc. are sensitive to the relative mass spilitting, therefore helpful in defining SR \textbf{Low-x}/\textbf{High-x}.
