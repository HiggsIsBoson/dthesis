%%%%%%%% CR %%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Control Regions} \mbox{} \\
Figure \ref{fig::BGestimation::CRpostFit::WR2J}-\ref{fig::BGestimation::CRpostFit::TR3B} show the kinematical distruibution in after the MC normalization. Blue arrows indicate the CRs that the MC is normalized.

%%%%%%%% VR %%%%%%%%%%
\clearpage
\paragraph{Validation Regions} \mbox{} \\
Figure \ref{fig::BGestimation::SRVRpostFit::VR2J}-\ref{fig::BGestimation::SRVRpostFit::VR3B} display the distruibution of data and the estimated background in VRs,
in terms of the kinematical variables which VRs are designed to test i.e. $\mt$ for VRa and $\apl$/topness etc. for VRb. The white component is the background estimated by the object replacement while the colored ones are by the kinematical extrapolation.
Blue arrows indicate the cut position with which the VRs are defined.
