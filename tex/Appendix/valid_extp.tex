\subsection{Extrapolation Error due to the MC Mis-modeling} \label{sec::App::valid_extp}
The impact of the unaccounted MC mis-modeling found in the pre-selection (see Sec. \ref{sec::BGestimation::dataMC}) on the extrapolation from CRs to SRs (VRs) is evaluated by the procedure described in Sec. \ref{sec::Uncertainties::nonClosure} (``Kinematical extrapolation method'').
Figure \ref{fig::BGestimation::valid_extp_2J}-\ref{fig::BGestimation::valid_extp_VRb6J} display the result as function of the linear coefficiency $x$ in Eq. (\ref{eq::BGestimation::injected_MCvariation}); The top pannels show the yield variation of $\wjets$ (left) and $\ttbar$ (right) when the MC events are reweighted by Eq. (\ref{eq::BGestimation::injected_MCvariation}) as function of the coefficiency $w$; Bottom rows are the relative difference in their response against the injected variation, namely the extrapolation error.
