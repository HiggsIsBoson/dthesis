\subsection{Detail Configuration of Event Generation} \label{sec::Appendix::sample_detail}
\paragraph{\underline{$W/Z$+jets}}  \mbox{} \\
Events involing a leptonically decaying $W/Z$ boson with associated jets are simulated using the \sherpa2.2.1 generator~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta}
The matrix elements are calculated up to two partons at NLO and four partons at LO\@ using the Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and OpenLoops~\cite{Cascioli:2011va} generators. 
Parton showers are generated by the internal algorithm of \sherpa2.2.1 ~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} and merged based on the ME+PS@NLO prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}.
The CKKW scheme is used for ME/PS matching with matching scale set to $30\gev$.
Hadronic decay modes of $W/Z$ are not included in the sample.


% ttbar, 1top  $Wt$ and $s$-channel~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-004},
\paragraph{\underline{Tops ($\ttbar$/single-top)}}  \mbox{} \\
The events are generated using the \textsc{powheg-box} generator, explicily designating diagrams involing top-quarks.
The generator parameters are set to well-accounting for the data in LHC Run1 \cite{ATLAS_ttbarGen_Run1}.
The interference between $\ttbar$ and $Wt+b$ is taken into account by the Diagram Removal scheme \cite{ttWt_intf_LHC}.
The EvtGen v1.2.0 program~\cite{EvtGen} is used to correct the bottom and charm hadron decays (``after burner''). 
Parton shower and underlying events are simulated using the interfaced $\pythia$ 6.



\paragraph{\underline{Di-bosons: WW/WZ/ZZ}}  \mbox{} \\
All samples are simulated by the \sherpa2.2.1 generator.
Full leptonic processes are simulated with five final states ($\ell\ell\ell\ell$, $\ell\ell\ell\nu$, $\ell\ell\nu\nu$, $\ell\nu\nu\nu$, $\nu\nu\nu\nu$). The intermediated states are not specified therefore the contribution from Drell-Yan-like off-shell diboson and the interference between different diboson processes (e.g. $WW\ra\ell\ell\nu\nu$ and $WZ\ra\ell\ell\nu\nu$) are taken into account. The semi-leptonic diboson processes ($WW/WZ \ra \ell\nu qq$, $WZ/ZZ \ra \ell\ell qq$) are simulated with explicitly designating the intermediated states ($W$ or $Z$), therefore no interference amplitude between them is accounted. 
Full hadronic diboson events are not included in the sample.
%The processes are calculated for up to one parton (for $ZZ$) or no additional partons (for $WW, WZ$) at NLO and up to three partons at LO using the Comix and OpenLoops matrix-element generators.


%For the $t\bar{t}+W/Z/WW$ processes~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-005}
\paragraph{\underline{$\ttbar+W/Z/WW$}}  \mbox{} \\
All processes are simulated by \mgmc 2.2.3 at LO interfaced to the \pythia 8.186 parton shower model, 
with up to two ($t\bar{t}+W$), one ($t\bar{t}+Z$) or no ($t\bar{t}+WW$) extra partons included in the matrix element.  
%The EvtGen v1.2.0 program~\cite{EvtGen} is used to describe the properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays.  


\paragraph{\underline{SUSY signals}} \label{sec::Samples::SUSY}  \mbox{} \\
Decay of EW gauginos are done in \pythia , based on phase space with no consideration of the spin.
The CKKW-L matching scheme~\cite{CKKW} is applied for the matching of the matrix element and the parton shower, with the corresponding scale parameter set to 1/4 of the gluino mass. 
The cross-section uncertainty are taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorization and renormalisation scales, as described in Ref.~\cite{Borschensky:2014cia}, considering only the four light-flavor left-handed squarks ($\tilde{u}_L$, $\tilde{d}_L$, $\tilde{s}_L$, and $\tilde{c}_L$). Figure \ref{fig::Samples::xsec_GG} shows the calculated cross-section and the associated error. Model parameters irrelevant to SUSY masses are fixed to arbitrary reasonable values, 
since presumably they do not change the kinematics as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec::Introduction::strategy}.
The mixing parameters are set so that LSP and NLSP are bino- and wino-like. \\
