{Theory systematics assigned for the yields of $\zjets$ [$\%$]. The uncertainty is shared by SRs and corresponding VRs. Systematics contributing below 5$\%$ or 5 times less than that of the leading uncertainty in the region are ignored (labeled as "-"). The uncertainties in the 3B towers are not evaluated since the $\zjets$ contribution is negligible. }
