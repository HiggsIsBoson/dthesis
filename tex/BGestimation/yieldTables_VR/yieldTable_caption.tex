\newcommand{\vrtablecaption}[1]{%
      Event yields and the background-only fit results in the #1 control regions. 
      Each column corresponds to a bin in $\meffInc$.
      Uncertainties in the MC estimates combine statistical (in the simulated event yields) and systematic uncertainties discussed in Sec \ref{sec::Uncertainties}. The uncertainties in this table are symmetrised for propagation purposes but truncated at zero to remain within the physical boundaries.
