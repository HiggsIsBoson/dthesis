@article{Topness,
abstract = {We point out that in the irreducible natural SUSY spectrum, stops have comparable branching fractions to chargino-bottom and neutralino-top in the vast bulk of parameter space, provided only that both decay modes are kinematically accessible. The total stop pair branching fractions into ttbar + MET can therefore be reduced to O(50{\%}), while b bbar + X branching fractions are typically much smaller, O(10{\%}), thus limiting the reach of traditional stop searches. We propose a new stop search targeting the asymmetric final state $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} t chi{\^{}}0 b chi{\^{}}pm, which can restore sensitivity to natural stops in the 7 and 8 TeV LHC runs. In addition we present a new variable, topness, which efficiently suppresses the dominant top backgrounds to semi-leptonic top partner searches. We demonstrate the utility of topness in both our asymmetric search channel and traditional $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} ttbar + MET searches and show that it matches or out-performs existing variables.},

@article{TAUOLA2,
abstract = {We present the system for maintaining the versions of two packages: the TAUOLA of $\tau$-lepton decay and PHOTOS for radiative corrections in decays. The following features can be chosen in an automatic or semi-automatic way: (1) format of the common block HEPEVT; (2) version of the physics input (for TAUOLA): as published, as initialized by the CLEO collaboration, as initialized by the ALEPH collaboration (it is suggested to use this version only with the help of the collaboration advice), new optional parametrization of matrix elements in 4$\pi$ decay channels; (3) type of application: stand-alone, universal interface based on the information stored in the HEPEVT common block including longitudinal spin effects in the elementary Z / $\gamma$* → $\tau$+ $\tau$- process, extended version of the standard universal interface including full spin effects in the H / A → $\tau$+ $\tau$- decay, interface for KKMC Monte Carlo, (4) random number generators; (5) compiler options. The last section of the paper contains documentation of the programs updates introduced over the last two years. Program summary: Title of program: tauola-photos-F, release II. Catalogue identifier:ADXO{\_}v1{\_}0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADXO{\_}v1{\_}0. Programs obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University of Belfast, N. Ireland. Computer: PC running GNU/Linux operating system. Programming languages and tools used: CPP: standard C-language preprocessor, GNU Make builder tool, also FORTRAN compiler. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 194 118. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:2 481 234. Distribution format: tar.gz.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:2 988 363. Distribution format:tar.gz. Does the new version supersede the previous version:Yes. Nature of the physical problem: The code of Monte Carlo generators often has to be tuned to the needs of large HEP Collaborations and experiments. Usually, these modifications do not introduce important changes in the algorithm, but rather modify the initialization and form of the hadronic current in $\tau$ decays. The format of the event record (HEPEVT common block) used to exchange information between building blocks of Monte Carlo systems often needs modification. Thus, there is a need to maintain various, slightly modified versions of the same code. The package presented here allows the production of ready-to-compile versions of TAUOLA [S. Jadach, Z. Wa̧s, R. Decker, J.H. K{\"{u}}hn, Comput. Phys. Comm. 76 (1993) 361; A.E. Bondar, et al., Comput. Phys. Comm. 146 (2002) 139] and PHOTOS [E. Barberio, Z. Wa̧s, Comput. Phys. Comm. 79 (1994) 291] Monte Carlo generators with appropriate demonstration programs. The new algorithm, universal interface of TAUOLA to work with the HEPEVT common block, is also documented here. Finally, minor technical improvements of TAUOLA and PHOTOS are also listed. Method of solution: The standard UNIX tool: the C-language preprocessor is used to produce a ready-to-distribute version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS code. The final FORTRAN code is produced from the library of 'pre-code' that is included in the package. Reasons for new version: The functionality of the version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS changed over the last two years. The changes, and their reasons, are documented in Section 9, and our new papers cited in this section. Additional comments: The updated version includes new features described in Section 9 of the paper. PHOTOS and TAUOLA were first submitted to the library as separate programs. Summary details of these previous programs are obtainable from the CPC Program Library. Typical running time: Depends on the speed of the computer used and the demonstration program chosen. Typically a few seconds. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{strong3B_3p2fb_paper,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 CERN.A search for supersymmetry involving the pair production of gluinos decaying via third-generation squarks to the lightest neutralino ($\chi$10) is reported. It uses an LHC proton-proton data set at a center-of-mass energy s=13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015. The signal is searched for in events containing several energetic jets, of which at least three must be identified as b jets, large missing transverse momentum, and, potentially, isolated electrons or muons. Large-radius jets with a high mass are also used to identify highly boosted top quarks. No excess is found above the predicted background. For $\chi$10 masses below approximately 700 GeV, gluino masses of less than 1.78 TeV and 1.76 TeV are excluded at the 95{\%} C.L. in simplified models of the pair production of gluinos decaying via sbottom and stop, respectively. These results significantly extend the exclusion limits obtained with the s=8 TeV data set.},

The dataset used was recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb- 1. Six signal selections are defined that best exploit the signal characteristics. The data agree with the Standard Model background expectation in all six signal selections, and the largest deviation is a 2.1 standard deviation excess. The results are interpreted in a simplified model where pair-produced gluinos decay via the lightest chargino to the lightest neutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to masses of approximately 1.6 Te V depending on the mass spectrum of the simplified model, thus surpassing the limits of previous searches.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2016.A search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing hadronic jets, missing transverse momentum but no electrons or muons is presented. The data were recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment in √s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation was observed in 3.2 fb−1 of analyzed data. Results are interpreted within simplified models that assume R-parity is conserved and the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An exclusion limit at the 95 {\%} confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at 1.51 TeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino octet and the lightest neutralino, assuming the lightest neutralino is massless. For a simplified model involving the strong production of mass-degenerate first- and second-generation squarks, squark masses below 1.03 TeV are excluded for a massless lightest neutralino. These limits substantially extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements with the ATLAS detector.},

Only spin degrees of freedom connect these two parts of the physics process of interest for high energy collision experiments. In the following, we present a Monte Carlo algorithm which is based on that property. The interface supplements events generated by other programs, with $\tau$ decays. Effects of spin, including transverse degrees of freedom, genuine weak corrections or of new physics may be taken into account at the time when a $\tau$ decay is generated and written into an event record.

@article{PDG2016,
abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},
