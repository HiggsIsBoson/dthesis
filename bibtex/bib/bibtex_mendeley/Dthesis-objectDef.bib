@article{155_JVT,
abstract = {The suppression of pileup jets has been a crucial component of many physics analyses using 2012 LHC proton-proton collisions. In ATLAS, tracking information has been used to calculate a variable called the jet-vertex-fraction, which is the fraction of the total momentum of tracks in the jet which is associated with the primary vertex. Imposing a lower limit on this variable rejects the majority of pileup jets, but leads to hard-scatter jet efficiencies that depend on the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event (NVtx). In this note, new track-based variables to suppress pileup jets are developed in such a way that the resulting hard-scatter jet efficiency is stable as a function of NVtx. A multivariate combination of two such variables called the jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) is constructed. The modeling of JVT is tested in Z(→ $\mu$$\mu$)+jets as well as in semileptonic ttbar events. The efficiencies of different JVT criteria are measured in data and compared to simulation. In addition, it is shown that jet-vertex association can be applied to large-R jets, providing a track-based grooming technique that is as powerful as calorimeter-based trimming but based on complementary tracking information. Finally, the performance of track-based grooming is compared with the recently proposed jet cleansing algorithm.},

@article{Topness,
abstract = {We point out that in the irreducible natural SUSY spectrum, stops have comparable branching fractions to chargino-bottom and neutralino-top in the vast bulk of parameter space, provided only that both decay modes are kinematically accessible. The total stop pair branching fractions into ttbar + MET can therefore be reduced to O(50{\%}), while b bbar + X branching fractions are typically much smaller, O(10{\%}), thus limiting the reach of traditional stop searches. We propose a new stop search targeting the asymmetric final state $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} t chi{\^{}}0 b chi{\^{}}pm, which can restore sensitivity to natural stops in the 7 and 8 TeV LHC runs. In addition we present a new variable, topness, which efficiently suppresses the dominant top backgrounds to semi-leptonic top partner searches. We demonstrate the utility of topness in both our asymmetric search channel and traditional $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} ttbar + MET searches and show that it matches or out-performs existing variables.},

@article{bTag_Run2_2015data,
abstract = {The identification of jets containing {\$}b{\$} hadrons is important for the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Several algorithms to identify jets containing {\$}b{\$} hadrons are described, ranging from those based on the reconstruction of an inclusive secondary vertex or the presence of tracks with large impact parameters to combined tagging algorithms making use of multi-variate discriminants. An independent {\$}b{\$}-tagging algorithm based on the reconstruction of muons inside jets as well as the {\$}b{\$}-tagging algorithm used in the online trigger are also presented.The {\$}b{\$}-jet tagging efficiency, the {\$}c{\$}-jet tagging efficiency and the mistag rate for light flavour jets in data have been measured with a number of complementary methods. The calibration results are presented as scale factors defined as the ratio of the efficiency (or mistag rate) in data to that in simulation. In the case of {\$}b{\$} jets, where more than one calibration method exists, the results from the various analyses have been combined taking into account the statistical correlation as well as the correlation of the sources of systematic uncertainty.},
