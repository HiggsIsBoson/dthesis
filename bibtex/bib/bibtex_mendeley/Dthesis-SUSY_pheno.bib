abstract = {Cold dark matter (DM) scenario may be cured of several problems by involving self-interaction of dark matter. Viability of the models of long-range interacting DM crucially depends on the effectiveness of recombination of the DM particles, making thereby their interaction short-range. Usually in numeric calculations, recombination is described by cross section obtained on a feasible quantum level. However in a wide range of parameter values, a classical treatment, where the particles are bound due to dipole radiation, is applicable. The cross sections, obtained in both approaches, are very different and lead to diverse consequences. Classical cross section has a steeper dependence on relative velocity, what leads to the fact that, after decoupling of DM particles from thermal background of ???dark photons??? (carriers of DM long-range interaction), recombination process does not ???freeze out???, diminishing gradually density of unbound DM particles. Our simplified estimates show, that at the taken parameter values (the mass of DM particle is 100 GeV, interaction constant is 100???1, and quite natural assumptions on initial conditions, from which the result is very weakly dependent) the difference in residual density reaches about 5 orders of magnitude on pre-galactic stage. This estimate takes into account thermal effects induced by dipole radiation and recombination, which resulted in the increase of both temperature and density of DM particles by a half order of magnitude.},

@article{Barger2006,
abstract = {High-precision measurements of the relic dark matter density and the calculation of dark matter annihilation branching fractions in the sun or the galactic halo today motivate the computation of the neutralino annihilation cross section beyond leading order. We consider neutralino annihilation via squark exchange and parameterize the effective annihilation vertex as a dimension-six operator suppressed by two powers of the squark mass and related to the divergence of the axial vector current of the final-state quarks. Since the axial vector current is conserved at tree level in the limit of massless quarks, this dimension-six operator contains a suppression by the quark mass. The quark mass suppression can be lifted in two ways: (1) by corrections to the dimension-six operator involving the anomalous triangle diagram, and (2) by going to dimension-eight. We address the first of these possibilities by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram, which contributes to neutralino annihilation to gluon pairs. We relate the triangle diagram via the anomaly equation to the decay of a pseudoscalar into two gluons and use the Adler-Bardeen theorem to extract the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to ???????gg from the known corrections to pseudoscalar decay. The strong dependence of the dominant ???????qq?? cross section on the relative velocity of the neutralinos makes these NLO corrections unimportant at ?? decoupling but significant today. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The 7 TeV LHC will be sensitive to the moderately lived gluinos and trilepton signatures from direct electroweakino production. Moreover, the dark matter abundance may be obtained from annihilation through an s-channel Higgs resonance, with the LSP almost purely bino and mass m{\_}chi = 70 GeV. The Higgs resonance region of Split Susy has visible signatures in dark matter direct and indirect detection and electric dipole moment experiments.

@article{SUSYDM_BWCA,
abstract = {In supersymmetric models with non-universal gaugino masses, it is possible to have opposite-sign SU(2) and U(1) gaugino mass terms. In these models, the gaugino eigenstates experience little mixing so that the lightest SUSY particle remains either pure bino or pure wino. The neutralino relic density can only be brought into accord with the WMAP measured value when bino-wino co-annihilation (BWCA) acts to enhance the dark matter annihilation rate. We map out parameter space regions and mass spectra which are characteristic of the BWCA scenario. Direct and indirect dark matter detection rates are shown to be typically very low. At collider experiments, the BWCA scenario is typified by a small mass gap m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tilde Z{\_}2{\}}-m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tilde Z{\_}1{\}} {\~{}} 20-80 GeV, so that tree level two body decays of $\backslash$tilde Z{\_}2 are not allowed. However, in this case the second lightest neutralino has an enhanced loop decay branching fraction to photons. While the photonic neutralino decay signature looks difficult to extract at the Fermilab Tevatron, it should lead to distinctive events at the CERN LHC and at a linear e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}- collider.},

@article{Papucci2012,
abstract = {The first 1/fb of LHC searches have set impressive limits on new colored particles decaying to missing energy. We address the implication of these searches for naturalness in supersymmetry (SUSY). General bottom-up considerations of natural electroweak symmetry breaking show that higgsinos, stops, and the gluino should not be too far above the weak scale. The rest of the spectrum, including the squarks of the first two generations, can be heavier and beyond the current LHC reach. We have used collider simulations to determine the limits that all of the 1/fb searches pose on higgsinos, stops, and the gluino. We find that stops and the left-handed sbottom are starting to be constrained and must be heavier than about 200-300 GeV when decaying to higgsinos. The gluino must be heavier than about 600-800 GeV when it decays to stops and sbottoms. While these findings point toward scenarios with a lighter third generation split from the other squarks, we do find that moderately-tuned regions remain, where the gluino is just above 1 TeV and all the squarks are degenerate and light. Among all the searches, jets plus missing energy and same-sign dileptons often provide the most powerful probes of natural SUSY. Overall, our results indicate that natural SUSY has survived the first 1/fb of data. The LHC is now on the brink of exploring the most interesting region of SUSY parameter space.},

@article{Casas2015,
abstract = {The idea of "Natural SUSY", understood as a supersymmetric scenario where the fine-tuning is as mild as possible, is a reasonable guide to explore supersymmetric phenomenology. In this paper, we re-examine this issue in the context of the MSSM including several improvements, such as the mixing of the fine-tuning conditions for different soft terms and the presence of potential extra fine-tunings that must be combined with the electroweak one. We give tables and plots that allow to easily evaluate the fine-tuning and the corresponding naturalness bounds for any theoretical model defined at any high-energy (HE) scale. Then, we analyze in detail the complete fine-tuning bounds for the unconstrained MSSM, defined at any HE scale. We show that Natural SUSY does not demand light stops. Actually, an average stop mass below 800 GeV is disfavored, though one of the stops might be very light. Regarding phenomenology, the most stringent upper bound from naturalness is the one on the gluino mass, which typically sets the present level of fine-tuning at {\$}{\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(1\backslash{\%}){\$}. However, this result presents a strong dependence on the HE scale. E.g. if the latter is {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} GeV the level of fine-tuning is {\$}\backslashsim{\$} four times less severe. Finally, the most robust result of Natural SUSY is by far that Higgsinos should be rather light, certainly below 700 GeV for a fine-tuning of {\$}{\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(1\backslash{\%}){\$} or milder. Incidentally, this upper bound is not far from {\$}\backslashsimeq1{\$} TeV, which is the value required if dark matter is made of Higgsinos.},

In this context, the most important questions that need to be addressed are: "To what extent can we constrain the WIMP models in the future?" and "What will then be the remaining unexplored regions in the WIMP parameter space for each of these models?" In our quest to answer these questions, we classify WIMP in terms of quantum number and study each case adopting minimality as a guiding principle. As a first step, we study one of the simple cases of the minimal composition in the well-tempered fermionic WIMP regime, namely the singlet-doublets WIMP model. We consider all available constraints from direct and indirect searches and also the predicted constraints coming from the near future and the future experiments. We thus obtain the current status, the near future prospects and the future prospects of this model in all its generality. We find that in the future, this model will be constrained almost solely by the future direct dark matter detection experiments (as compared to the weaker indirect and collider constraints) and the cosmological (relic density) constraints and will hence be gradually pushed to the corner of the coannihilation region, if no WIMP signal is detected. Future lepton colliders will then be useful in exploring this region not constrained by any other experiments.},

Using an effective-theory approach, we resum the large logarithmic corrections controlled by the strong gauge coupling and the top Yukawa coupling. We find that the resummation of the radiative corrections has a sizeable numerical impact on the gluino decay width and branching ratios. Finally, we discuss the gluino decays into gravitino, relevant in models with direct mediation of supersymmetry breaking. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{pMSSMbenchmarkSnowMass2013,
abstract = {We present several benchmark points in the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM). We select these models as experimentally well-motivated examples of the MSSM which predict the observed Higgs mass and dark matter relic density while evading the current LHC searches. We also use benchmarks to generate spokes in parameter space by scaling the mass parameters in a manner which keeps the Higgs mass and relic density approximately constant.},
