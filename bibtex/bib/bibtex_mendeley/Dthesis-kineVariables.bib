@article{Topness,
abstract = {We point out that in the irreducible natural SUSY spectrum, stops have comparable branching fractions to chargino-bottom and neutralino-top in the vast bulk of parameter space, provided only that both decay modes are kinematically accessible. The total stop pair branching fractions into ttbar + MET can therefore be reduced to O(50{\%}), while b bbar + X branching fractions are typically much smaller, O(10{\%}), thus limiting the reach of traditional stop searches. We propose a new stop search targeting the asymmetric final state $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} t chi{\^{}}0 b chi{\^{}}pm, which can restore sensitivity to natural stops in the 7 and 8 TeV LHC runs. In addition we present a new variable, topness, which efficiently suppresses the dominant top backgrounds to semi-leptonic top partner searches. We demonstrate the utility of topness in both our asymmetric search channel and traditional $\backslash${\~{}}t$\backslash${\~{}}t* --{\textgreater} ttbar + MET searches and show that it matches or out-performs existing variables.},
