abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb-1 collected at ???s = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb-1 at ???s = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H ??? ZZ(*) ??? 4l, H ??? ???? and H ??? WW(*) e?????? in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H ??? ZZ(*), WW(*), bb and ??+??- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H ??? ZZ(*) ???4l and H ??? ???? channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0??0.4 (stat)??0.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7??10-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},

abstract = {A measurement of the underlying event (UE) activity in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is performed using Drell-Yan events in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2. 2 fb -1, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The activity measured in the muonic final state (qq̄ → $\mu$ +$\mu$ -) is corrected to the particle level and compared with the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators and hadronization models. The dependence of the UE activity on the dimuon invariant mass is well described by pythia and herwig++ tunes derived from the leading jet/track approach, illustrating the universality of the UE activity. The UE activity is observed to be independent of the dimuon invariant mass in the region above 40 GeV/c 2, while a slow increase is observed with increasing transverse momentum of the dimuon system. The dependence of the UE activity on the transverse momentum of the dimuon system is accurately described by madgraph, which simulates multiple hard emissions. {\textcopyright} 2012 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.},

@article{PDG2016,
abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},

@article{Belotsky2016,
abstract = {Cold dark matter (DM) scenario may be cured of several problems by involving self-interaction of dark matter. Viability of the models of long-range interacting DM crucially depends on the effectiveness of recombination of the DM particles, making thereby their interaction short-range. Usually in numeric calculations, recombination is described by cross section obtained on a feasible quantum level. However in a wide range of parameter values, a classical treatment, where the particles are bound due to dipole radiation, is applicable. The cross sections, obtained in both approaches, are very different and lead to diverse consequences. Classical cross section has a steeper dependence on relative velocity, what leads to the fact that, after decoupling of DM particles from thermal background of ???dark photons??? (carriers of DM long-range interaction), recombination process does not ???freeze out???, diminishing gradually density of unbound DM particles. Our simplified estimates show, that at the taken parameter values (the mass of DM particle is 100 GeV, interaction constant is 100???1, and quite natural assumptions on initial conditions, from which the result is very weakly dependent) the difference in residual density reaches about 5 orders of magnitude on pre-galactic stage. This estimate takes into account thermal effects induced by dipole radiation and recombination, which resulted in the increase of both temperature and density of DM particles by a half order of magnitude.},

abstract = {High-precision measurements of the relic dark matter density and the calculation of dark matter annihilation branching fractions in the sun or the galactic halo today motivate the computation of the neutralino annihilation cross section beyond leading order. We consider neutralino annihilation via squark exchange and parameterize the effective annihilation vertex as a dimension-six operator suppressed by two powers of the squark mass and related to the divergence of the axial vector current of the final-state quarks. Since the axial vector current is conserved at tree level in the limit of massless quarks, this dimension-six operator contains a suppression by the quark mass. The quark mass suppression can be lifted in two ways: (1) by corrections to the dimension-six operator involving the anomalous triangle diagram, and (2) by going to dimension-eight. We address the first of these possibilities by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram, which contributes to neutralino annihilation to gluon pairs. We relate the triangle diagram via the anomaly equation to the decay of a pseudoscalar into two gluons and use the Adler-Bardeen theorem to extract the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to ???????gg from the known corrections to pseudoscalar decay. The strong dependence of the dominant ???????qq?? cross section on the relative velocity of the neutralinos makes these NLO corrections unimportant at ?? decoupling but significant today. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Moderate lifetime gluinos, with decay lengths in the 25 microns to 10 years range, are its imminent smoking gun signature. The 7 TeV LHC will be sensitive to the moderately lived gluinos and trilepton signatures from direct electroweakino production. Moreover, the dark matter abundance may be obtained from annihilation through an s-channel Higgs resonance, with the LSP almost purely bino and mass m{\_}chi = 70 GeV. The Higgs resonance region of Split Susy has visible signatures in dark matter direct and indirect detection and electric dipole moment experiments.

The following features can be chosen in an automatic or semi-automatic way: (1) format of the common block HEPEVT; (2) version of the physics input (for TAUOLA): as published, as initialized by the CLEO collaboration, as initialized by the ALEPH collaboration (it is suggested to use this version only with the help of the collaboration advice), new optional parametrization of matrix elements in 4$\pi$ decay channels; (3) type of application: stand-alone, universal interface based on the information stored in the HEPEVT common block including longitudinal spin effects in the elementary Z / $\gamma$* → $\tau$+ $\tau$- process, extended version of the standard universal interface including full spin effects in the H / A → $\tau$+ $\tau$- decay, interface for KKMC Monte Carlo, (4) random number generators; (5) compiler options.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:2 988 363. Distribution format:tar.gz. Does the new version supersede the previous version:Yes. Nature of the physical problem: The code of Monte Carlo generators often has to be tuned to the needs of large HEP Collaborations and experiments. Usually, these modifications do not introduce important changes in the algorithm, but rather modify the initialization and form of the hadronic current in $\tau$ decays. The format of the event record (HEPEVT common block) used to exchange information between building blocks of Monte Carlo systems often needs modification. Thus, there is a need to maintain various, slightly modified versions of the same code. The package presented here allows the production of ready-to-compile versions of TAUOLA [S. Jadach, Z. Wa̧s, R. Decker, J.H. K{\"{u}}hn, Comput. Phys. Comm. 76 (1993) 361; A.E. Bondar, et al., Comput. Phys. Comm. 146 (2002) 139] and PHOTOS [E. Barberio, Z. Wa̧s, Comput. Phys. Comm. 79 (1994) 291] Monte Carlo generators with appropriate demonstration programs. The new algorithm, universal interface of TAUOLA to work with the HEPEVT common block, is also documented here. Finally, minor technical improvements of TAUOLA and PHOTOS are also listed. Method of solution: The standard UNIX tool: the C-language preprocessor is used to produce a ready-to-distribute version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS code. The final FORTRAN code is produced from the library of 'pre-code' that is included in the package. Reasons for new version: The functionality of the version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS changed over the last two years. The changes, and their reasons, are documented in Section 9, and our new papers cited in this section. Additional comments: The updated version includes new features described in Section 9 of the paper. PHOTOS and TAUOLA were first submitted to the library as separate programs. Summary details of these previous programs are obtainable from the CPC Program Library. Typical running time: Depends on the speed of the computer used and the demonstration program chosen. Typically a few seconds. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@techreport{ATLASComputing,
abstract = {The ATLAS Computing Model embraces the Grid paradigm and a high degree of decentralization and sharing of computing resources. The required level of computing resources means that off-site facilities will be vital to the operation of ATLAS in a way that was not the case for previous CERN-based experiments. The primary event processing occurs at CERN in a Tier-0 facility. The RAW data is archived at CERN and copied (along with the primary processed data) to the Tier-1 facilities around the world. These facilities archive the raw data, provide the reprocessing capacity, provide access to the various processed versions, and allow scheduled analysis of the processed data by physics analysis groups. Derived datasets produced by the physics groups are copied to the Tier-2 facilities for further analysis. The Tier-2 facilities also provide the simulation capacity for the experiment, with the simulated data housed at Tier-1s. In addition, Tier-2 centres will provide analysis facilities, and some will provide the capacity to produce calibrations based on processing raw data. A CERN Analysis Facility provides an additional analysis capacity, with an important role in the calibration and algorithmic development work. ATLAS has adopted an object-oriented approach to software, based primarily on the C++ programming language, but with some components implemented using FORTRAN and Java. A component-based model has been adopted, whereby applications are built up from collections of plug-compatible components based on a variety of configuration files. This capability is supported by a common framework that provides common data-processing support. This approach results in great flexibility in meeting the basic processing needs of the experiment, and also for responding to changing requirements throughout its lifetime. The heavy use of abstract interfaces allows for different implementations to be provided, supporting different persistency technologies, or optimized for the offline or high-level trigger environments. The Athena framework is an enhanced version of the Gaudi framework that was originally developed by the LHCb experiment, but is now a common ATLAS-LHCb project. Major design principles are the clear separation of data and algorithms, and of transient (in-memory) and persistent (in-file) data. All levels of processing of ATLAS data, from high-level trigger to event simulation, reconstruction and analysis, take place within the Athena framework; in this way it is easier for code developers and users to test and run algorithmic code, with the assurance that all geometry and conditions data will be the same for all types of applications (simulation, reconstruction, analysis, visualization). One of the principal challenges for ATLAS computing is to develop and operate a data storage and management infrastructure able to meet the demands of a yearly data volume of O(10 PB) utilized by data processing and analysis activities spread around the world. The ATLAS Computing Model establishes the environment and operational requirements that ATLAS data-handling systems must support, and, together with the operational experience gained to date in test beams and data challenges, provides the primary guidance for the development of the data management systems. The ATLAS Databases and Data Management Project (DB Project) leads and coordinates ATLAS activities in these areas, with a scope encompassing technical databases (detector production, installation and survey data), detector geometry, online/TDAQ databases, conditions databases (online and offline), event data, offline processing configuration and book-keeping, distributed data management, and distributed database and data management services. The project is responsible for ensuring the coherent development, integration, and operational capability of the distributed database and data management software and infrastructure for ATLAS across these areas. The ATLAS Computing Model foresees the distribution of raw and processed data to Tier-1 and Tier-2 centres, so as to be able to exploit fully the computing resources that are made available to the Collaboration. Additional computing resources will be available for data processing and analysis at Tier-3 centres and other computing facilities to which ATLAS may have access. A complex set of tools and distributed services, enabling the automatic distribution and processing of the large amounts of data, has been developed and deployed by ATLAS in cooperation with the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) Project and with the middleware providers of the three large Grid infrastructures we use: EGEE, OSG and NorduGrid. The tools are designed in a flexible way, in order to have the possibility to extend them to use other types of Grid middleware in the future. These tools, and the service infrastructure on which they depend, were initially developed in the context of centrally managed, distributed Monte Carlo production exercises. They will be re-used wherever possible to create systems and tools for individual users to access data and compute resources, providing a distributed analysis environment for general usage by the ATLAS Collaboration. The first version of the production system was deployed in summer 2004 and has been used since the second half of 2004. It was used for Data Challenge 2, for the production of simulated data for the 5th ATLAS Physics Workshop (Rome, June 2005) and for the reconstruction and analysis of the 2004 Combined Test-Beam data. The main computing operations that ATLAS will have to run comprise the preparation, distribution and validation of ATLAS software, and the computing and data management operations run centrally on Tier-0, Tier-1s and Tier-2s. The ATLAS Virtual Organization will allow production and analysis users to run jobs and access data at remote sites using the ATLAS-developed Grid tools. In the past few years the Computing Model has been tested and developed by running Data Challenges of increasing scope and magnitude, as was proposed by the LHC Computing Review in 2001. We have run two major Data Challenges since 2002 and performed other massive productions in order to provide simulated data to the physicists and to reconstruct and analyse real data coming from test-beam activities; this experience is now useful in setting up the operations model for the start of LHC data-taking in 2007. The Computing Model, together with the knowledge of the resources needed to store and process each ATLAS event, gives rise to estimates of required resources that can be used to design and set up the various facilities. It is not assumed that all Tier-1s or Tier-2s will be of the same size; however, in order to ensure a smooth operation of the Computing Model, all Tier-1s should have broadly similar proportions of disk, tape and CPU, and the same should apply for the Tier-2s. The organization of the ATLAS Software {\&} Computing Project reflects all areas of activity within the project itself. Strong high-level links have been established with other parts of the ATLAS organization, such as the T-DAQ Project and Physics Coordination, through cross-representation in the respective steering boards. The Computing Management Board, and in particular the Planning Officer, acts to make sure that software and computing developments take place coherently across sub-systems and that the project as a whole meets its milestones. The International Computing Board assures the information flow between the ATLAS Software {\&} Computing Project and the national resources and their Funding Agencies.},

abstract = {Cross sections for e+e− → n-jets, as functions of the jet resolution parameter ycut, are computed according to a new clustering algorithm. The jet multiplicity n is defined in such a way that jets i and j with energies Ei and Ej at relative angle angle $\theta$ij are resolved if yij = 2(1−cos$\theta$ij) min (Ei2, Ej2)s{\textgreater}ycut, where s is the centre-of-mass energy squared. Using this algorithm, large higher-order corrections at small values of ycut can easily be evaluated. Our calculations include resummation of leading and next-to-leading logarithms of ycut to all orders in QCD perturbation theory. This enables us to predict the jet cross sections at small ycut for arbitrary n. Simple analytical results for n⩽5 are presented.},

abstract = {We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W+c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.},

After the EPS 2011 conference, LHC excludes the "Higgs-resonance" region of DM freeze-out and Xenon100 disfavors the "well-tempered" bino/higgsino, realized in the "focus-point" region of the CMSSM parameter space.

abstract = {The ATLAS trigger system has been used very successfully for the online event selection during the LHC's first run (Run-1) between 2009 and 2013 at centre-of-mass energies (√s) between 900 GeV and 8 TeV. The trigger system consists of a hardware Level-1 (L1) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT) that reduces the event rate from the design bunch- crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of a few hundred Hz. During the next data-taking period (Run-2) starting in early 2015, the LHC will operate at √s =13TeV, resulting in roughly five times higher trigger rates. We will review the upgrades to the ATLAS trigger system that have been implemented during the long shutdown and that will allow us to cope with these increased trigger rates while maintaining or even improving our efficiencies to select relevant physics processes. These include changes to the L1 calorimeter trigger, the introduction of new L1 topological trigger modules, improvements in the L1 muon system and the merging of the previous two-level HLT system into a single event-filter farm. Finally, we will summarize the commissioning status of the trigger system in view of the imminent restart of data-taking. 1.},

@article{155_JVT,
abstract = {The suppression of pileup jets has been a crucial component of many physics analyses using 2012 LHC proton-proton collisions. In ATLAS, tracking information has been used to calculate a variable called the jet-vertex-fraction, which is the fraction of the total momentum of tracks in the jet which is associated with the primary vertex. Imposing a lower limit on this variable rejects the majority of pileup jets, but leads to hard-scatter jet efficiencies that depend on the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event (NVtx). In this note, new track-based variables to suppress pileup jets are developed in such a way that the resulting hard-scatter jet efficiency is stable as a function of NVtx. A multivariate combination of two such variables called the jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) is constructed. The modeling of JVT is tested in Z(→ $\mu$$\mu$)+jets as well as in semileptonic ttbar events. The efficiencies of different JVT criteria are measured in data and compared to simulation. In addition, it is shown that jet-vertex association can be applied to large-R jets, providing a track-based grooming technique that is as powerful as calorimeter-based trimming but based on complementary tracking information. Finally, the performance of track-based grooming is compared with the recently proposed jet cleansing algorithm.},

@article{SUSYDM_BWCA,
abstract = {In supersymmetric models with non-universal gaugino masses, it is possible to have opposite-sign SU(2) and U(1) gaugino mass terms. In these models, the gaugino eigenstates experience little mixing so that the lightest SUSY particle remains either pure bino or pure wino. The neutralino relic density can only be brought into accord with the WMAP measured value when bino-wino co-annihilation (BWCA) acts to enhance the dark matter annihilation rate. We map out parameter space regions and mass spectra which are characteristic of the BWCA scenario. Direct and indirect dark matter detection rates are shown to be typically very low. At collider experiments, the BWCA scenario is typified by a small mass gap m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tilde Z{\_}2{\}}-m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tilde Z{\_}1{\}} {\~{}} 20-80 GeV, so that tree level two body decays of $\backslash$tilde Z{\_}2 are not allowed. However, in this case the second lightest neutralino has an enhanced loop decay branching fraction to photons. While the photonic neutralino decay signature looks difficult to extract at the Fermilab Tevatron, it should lead to distinctive events at the CERN LHC and at a linear e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}- collider.},

@article{Papucci2012,
abstract = {The first 1/fb of LHC searches have set impressive limits on new colored particles decaying to missing energy. We address the implication of these searches for naturalness in supersymmetry (SUSY). General bottom-up considerations of natural electroweak symmetry breaking show that higgsinos, stops, and the gluino should not be too far above the weak scale. The rest of the spectrum, including the squarks of the first two generations, can be heavier and beyond the current LHC reach. We have used collider simulations to determine the limits that all of the 1/fb searches pose on higgsinos, stops, and the gluino. We find that stops and the left-handed sbottom are starting to be constrained and must be heavier than about 200-300 GeV when decaying to higgsinos. The gluino must be heavier than about 600-800 GeV when it decays to stops and sbottoms. While these findings point toward scenarios with a lighter third generation split from the other squarks, we do find that moderately-tuned regions remain, where the gluino is just above 1 TeV and all the squarks are degenerate and light. Among all the searches, jets plus missing energy and same-sign dileptons often provide the most powerful probes of natural SUSY. Overall, our results indicate that natural SUSY has survived the first 1/fb of data. The LHC is now on the brink of exploring the most interesting region of SUSY parameter space.},

@article{Casas2015,
abstract = {The idea of "Natural SUSY", understood as a supersymmetric scenario where the fine-tuning is as mild as possible, is a reasonable guide to explore supersymmetric phenomenology. In this paper, we re-examine this issue in the context of the MSSM including several improvements, such as the mixing of the fine-tuning conditions for different soft terms and the presence of potential extra fine-tunings that must be combined with the electroweak one. We give tables and plots that allow to easily evaluate the fine-tuning and the corresponding naturalness bounds for any theoretical model defined at any high-energy (HE) scale. Then, we analyze in detail the complete fine-tuning bounds for the unconstrained MSSM, defined at any HE scale. We show that Natural SUSY does not demand light stops. Actually, an average stop mass below 800 GeV is disfavored, though one of the stops might be very light. Regarding phenomenology, the most stringent upper bound from naturalness is the one on the gluino mass, which typically sets the present level of fine-tuning at {\$}{\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(1\backslash{\%}){\$}. However, this result presents a strong dependence on the HE scale. E.g. if the latter is {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} GeV the level of fine-tuning is {\$}\backslashsim{\$} four times less severe. Finally, the most robust result of Natural SUSY is by far that Higgsinos should be rather light, certainly below 700 GeV for a fine-tuning of {\$}{\{}\backslashcal O{\}}(1\backslash{\%}){\$} or milder. Incidentally, this upper bound is not far from {\$}\backslashsimeq1{\$} TeV, which is the value required if dark matter is made of Higgsinos.},

abstract = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the WMAP mission. We provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate CMB anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (3.84+/-0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is 13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n{\_}s = 0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega{\_}k = -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit, the inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

Predictions for collider energies of 8 TeV, adopted to the present LHC run, and for 14 TeV, presumably relevant for the next round of LHC experiments, are presented. Kinematic regions with large momentum transfer are identified, where the corrections become large and may lead to strong distortions of differential distributions, thus mimicking anomalous top quark couplings. As a complementary case we investigate the threshold region, corresponding to configurations with small relative velocity between top and antitop quark, which is particularly sensitive to the top-quark Yukawa coupling. We demonstrate, that nontrivial upper limits on this coupling are well within reach of ongoing experiments.},

The dataset used was recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb- 1. Six signal selections are defined that best exploit the signal characteristics. The data agree with the Standard Model background expectation in all six signal selections, and the largest deviation is a 2.1 standard deviation excess. The results are interpreted in a simplified model where pair-produced gluinos decay via the lightest chargino to the lightest neutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to masses of approximately 1.6 Te V depending on the mass spectrum of the simplified model, thus surpassing the limits of previous searches.},

@article{Planck2015,
abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {Given the increasingly more stringent bounds on Supersymmetry (SUSY) from the LHC searches, we are motivated to explore the situation in which the only accessible SUSY states are the electroweakinos (charginos and neutralinos). In the minimal SUSY framework, we systematically study the three general scenarios classified by the relative size of the gaugino mass parameters M{\_}1, M{\_}2 and the Higgsino mass parameter $\backslash$mu, with six distinctive cases, four of which would naturally result in a compressed spectrum of nearly degenerate LSPs. We present the relevant decay branching fractions and provide insightful understanding about the decay modes in connection with the Goldstone-boson Equivalence Theorem. We show the cross sections for electroweakino pair production at the LHC and ILC, and emphasize the unique signals involving the Standard Model-like Higgs boson as a new search reference. The electroweakino signal from pair production and subsequent decay to Wh/Zh (h to b$\backslash$bar{\{}b{\}}) final state may yield a sensitivity of 95{\%} C.L. exclusion (5sigma discovery) to the mass scale M{\_}2, $\backslash$mu {\~{}} 350-400 GeV (220-270 GeV) at the 14 TeV LHC with an luminosity of 300 fb{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}. Combining with all the other decay channels, the 95{\%} C.L. exclusion (5sigma discovery) may be extended to M{\_}2, $\backslash$mu {\~{}} 480-700 GeV (320-500 GeV). At the ILC, the electroweakinos could be readily discovered once the kinematical threshold is crossed, and their properties could be thoroughly studied.},

abstract = {Serious searches for the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) have now begun. In this context, the most important questions that need to be addressed are: "To what extent can we constrain the WIMP models in the future?" and "What will then be the remaining unexplored regions in the WIMP parameter space for each of these models?" In our quest to answer these questions, we classify WIMP in terms of quantum number and study each case adopting minimality as a guiding principle. As a first step, we study one of the simple cases of the minimal composition in the well-tempered fermionic WIMP regime, namely the singlet-doublets WIMP model. We consider all available constraints from direct and indirect searches and also the predicted constraints coming from the near future and the future experiments. We thus obtain the current status, the near future prospects and the future prospects of this model in all its generality. We find that in the future, this model will be constrained almost solely by the future direct dark matter detection experiments (as compared to the weaker indirect and collider constraints) and the cosmological (relic density) constraints and will hence be gradually pushed to the corner of the coannihilation region, if no WIMP signal is detected. Future lepton colliders will then be useful in exploring this region not constrained by any other experiments.},

Our results are in the form of high-quality binned distributions. We offer predictions based on three different parton distribution function (pdf) sets. In the near future we will make our results available also in the more flexible fastNLO format that allows fast re-computation with any other pdf set. In order to be able to extend our calculation into the multi-TeV range we have had to derive a set of dynamic scales. Such scales are selected based on the principle of fastest perturbative convergence applied to the differential and inclusive cross-section. Many observations from our study are likely to be applicable and useful to other precision processes at the LHC. With scale uncertainty now under good control, pdfs arise as the leading source of uncertainty for TeV top production. Based on our findings, true precision in the boosted regime will likely only be possible after new and improved pdf sets appear. We expect that LHC top-quark data will play an important role in this process.},

abstract = {We study the distribution of lepton pairs from the second lightest neutralino decay $\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}2$\backslash$to$\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}1 l{\^{}}+l{\^{}}-. This decay mode is important to measure the mass difference between $\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}2 and the lightest neutralino $\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}1, which helps to determine the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model at the CERN LHC. We found that the decay distribution strongly depends on the values of underlying MSSM parameters. For some extreme cases, the amplitude near the end point of the lepton invariant mass distribution can be suppressed so strongly that one needs the information of the whole m{\_}{\{}ll{\}} distribution to extract m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}2{\}}-m{\_}{\{}$\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}1{\}}. On the other hand, if systematic errors on the acceptance can be controlled, this distribution can be used to constrain slepton masses and the Z$\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}2$\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}1 coupling. Measurements of the velocity distribution of $\backslash$tchi{\^{}}0{\_}2 from samples near the end point of the m{\_}{\{}ll{\}} distribution, and of the asymmetry of the p{\_}T of leptons, would be useful to reduce the systematic errors.},

abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034cm−2s−1(1027cm−2s−1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4$\pi$ solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|$\eta$| {\textless}= 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

@article{PerugiaTune2010,
abstract = {We present 9 new tunes of the pT-ordered shower and underlying-event model in PYTHIA 6.4. These "Perugia" tunes update and supersede the older "S0" family. The data sets used to constrain the models include hadronic Z0 decays at LEP, Tevatron minimum-bias data at 630, 1800, and 1960 GeV, Tevatron Drell-Yan data at 1800 and 1960 GeV, and SPS min-bias data at 200, 546, and 900 GeV. In addition to the central parameter set, called "Perugia 0", we introduce a set of 8 related "Perugia Variations" that attempt to systematically explore soft, hard, parton density, and colour structure variations in the theoretical parameters. Based on these variations, a best-guess prediction of the charged track multiplicity in inelastic, nondiffractive minimum-bias events at the LHC is made. Note that these tunes can only be used with PYTHIA 6, not with PYTHIA 8. Note: this report was updated in March 2011 with a new set of variations, collectively labeled "Perugia 2011", that are optimized for matching applications and which also take into account some lessons from the early LHC data. In order not to break the original text, these are described separately in Appendix B. Note 2: a subsequent "Perugia 2012" update is described in Appendix C.},
