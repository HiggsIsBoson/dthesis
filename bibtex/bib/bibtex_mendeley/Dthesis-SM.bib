abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb-1 collected at ???s = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb-1 at ???s = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H ??? ZZ(*) ??? 4l, H ??? ???? and H ??? WW(*) e?????? in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H ??? ZZ(*), WW(*), bb and ??+??- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H ??? ZZ(*) ???4l and H ??? ???? channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0??0.4 (stat)??0.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7??10-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},

@article{PDG2016,
abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},

Only spin degrees of freedom connect these two parts of the physics process of interest for high energy collision experiments.

Effects of spin, including transverse degrees of freedom, genuine weak corrections or of new physics may be taken into account at the time when a $\tau$ decay is generated and written into an event record.

abstract = {We present the system for maintaining the versions of two packages: the TAUOLA of $\tau$-lepton decay and PHOTOS for radiative corrections in decays. The following features can be chosen in an automatic or semi-automatic way: (1) format of the common block HEPEVT; (2) version of the physics input (for TAUOLA): as published, as initialized by the CLEO collaboration, as initialized by the ALEPH collaboration (it is suggested to use this version only with the help of the collaboration advice), new optional parametrization of matrix elements in 4$\pi$ decay channels; (3) type of application: stand-alone, universal interface based on the information stored in the HEPEVT common block including longitudinal spin effects in the elementary Z / $\gamma$* → $\tau$+ $\tau$- process, extended version of the standard universal interface including full spin effects in the H / A → $\tau$+ $\tau$- decay, interface for KKMC Monte Carlo, (4) random number generators; (5) compiler options. The last section of the paper contains documentation of the programs updates introduced over the last two years. Program summary: Title of program: tauola-photos-F, release II.

No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 194 118. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:2 481 234. Distribution format: tar.gz.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.:2 988 363. Distribution format:tar.gz. Does the new version supersede the previous version:Yes. Nature of the physical problem: The code of Monte Carlo generators often has to be tuned to the needs of large HEP Collaborations and experiments. Usually, these modifications do not introduce important changes in the algorithm, but rather modify the initialization and form of the hadronic current in $\tau$ decays. The format of the event record (HEPEVT common block) used to exchange information between building blocks of Monte Carlo systems often needs modification. Thus, there is a need to maintain various, slightly modified versions of the same code. The package presented here allows the production of ready-to-compile versions of TAUOLA [S. Jadach, Z. Wa̧s, R. Decker, J.H. K{\"{u}}hn, Comput. Phys. Comm. 76 (1993) 361; A.E. Bondar, et al., Comput. Phys. Comm. 146 (2002) 139] and PHOTOS [E. Barberio, Z. Wa̧s, Comput. Phys. Comm. 79 (1994) 291] Monte Carlo generators with appropriate demonstration programs. The new algorithm, universal interface of TAUOLA to work with the HEPEVT common block, is also documented here. Finally, minor technical improvements of TAUOLA and PHOTOS are also listed. Method of solution: The standard UNIX tool: the C-language preprocessor is used to produce a ready-to-distribute version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS code. The final FORTRAN code is produced from the library of 'pre-code' that is included in the package. Reasons for new version: The functionality of the version of TAUOLA and PHOTOS changed over the last two years. The changes, and their reasons, are documented in Section 9, and our new papers cited in this section. Additional comments: The updated version includes new features described in Section 9 of the paper. PHOTOS and TAUOLA were first submitted to the library as separate programs. Summary details of these previous programs are obtainable from the CPC Program Library. Typical running time: Depends on the speed of the computer used and the demonstration program chosen. Typically a few seconds. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV.

Predictions for collider energies of 8 TeV, adopted to the present LHC run, and for 14 TeV, presumably relevant for the next round of LHC experiments, are presented. Kinematic regions with large momentum transfer are identified, where the corrections become large and may lead to strong distortions of differential distributions, thus mimicking anomalous top quark couplings. As a complementary case we investigate the threshold region, corresponding to configurations with small relative velocity between top and antitop quark, which is particularly sensitive to the top-quark Yukawa coupling. We demonstrate, that nontrivial upper limits on this coupling are well within reach of ongoing experiments.},

Our results are in the form of high-quality binned distributions. We offer predictions based on three different parton distribution function (pdf) sets. In the near future we will make our results available also in the more flexible fastNLO format that allows fast re-computation with any other pdf set. In order to be able to extend our calculation into the multi-TeV range we have had to derive a set of dynamic scales. Such scales are selected based on the principle of fastest perturbative convergence applied to the differential and inclusive cross-section. Many observations from our study are likely to be applicable and useful to other precision processes at the LHC. With scale uncertainty now under good control, pdfs arise as the leading source of uncertainty for TeV top production. Based on our findings, true precision in the boosted regime will likely only be possible after new and improved pdf sets appear. We expect that LHC top-quark data will play an important role in this process.},
